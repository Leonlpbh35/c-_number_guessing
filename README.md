# easy-c++-number-guessing-game

Hello fellow programmer this is a simple number guessing game in c++ i am pretty new to c++ right now it still prints the number that was created you can easily remove it in line 16

i created the files with g++ i used the following commands:

g++ main.cpp -o main   
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
